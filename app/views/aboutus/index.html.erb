      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Bio::BaseSpace is a Ruby based SDK to be used in the development of Apps and scripts for working with Illumina's BaseSpace cloud-computing solution for next-gen sequencing data analysis.

The primary purpose of the SDK is to provide an easy-to-use Ruby environment enabling developers to authenticate a user, retrieve data, and upload data/results from their own analysis to BaseSpace.

Note: It will be necessary to have created a BaseSpace account with a new App and have the client_key and client_secret codes for the App available to run a number of the following examples.</p>
